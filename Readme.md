# Blind Schnorr Signature Implementation

## Overview
Blind Schnorr Signatures are a cryptographic protocol that enables a signer to generate a signature on a message without seeing its contents. This provides privacy and is useful in applications such as anonymous credentials and digital cash systems.

This repository implements the Blind Schnorr Signature scheme, including:
- Key generation
- Blind signing process
- Signature verification
- Secure randomization techniques

## How It Works
1. *Key Generation*: The signer generates a public-private key pair.
2. *Blinding*: The sender blinds their message so the signer cannot see its content.
3. *Signing*: The signer signs the blinded message.
4. *Unblinding*: The sender removes the blinding factor, obtaining a valid signature.
5. *Verification*: Anyone can verify the signature against the original message.

## Repository Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ schnorr_lib.py    # Core cryptographic functions
â”œâ”€â”€ blinding.py        # Handles the blinding process
â”œâ”€â”€ verify.py        # Signature verification
â”œâ”€â”€ signature.py       # signature creation
â”œâ”€â”€ key_gen.py       # Key generation 


## Installation & Setup
### Clone the Repository
sh
git clone https://github.com/rineet/blind_schnorr_implementation.git
cd blind_schnorr_implementation


### Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3 installed and install required libraries:
sh
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
### Key Generation
Run the key creator script to generate a key pair:
sh
python3 key_gen.py  

# users1.json will be created 

### Blind Signing Process
1. Run the blinding.py to run blind process where it create users1.json and from there we can get value of rnounce and public_key:
sh
python3 binding.py -r "rnounce" -p "public_key" -m "message"

# data.json will be created 

2. Use signature.py to create signature:
sh
python3 signature.py

### Unbinding and verification
1. Use verify.py to create signature:
sh
python3 verify.py

2. Inorder to check for other public key , signature , cin value one can use optional parsing like :
sh
python3 verify.py -r "rnounce" -s "random signature" -p "random public_key" -c "random cin value"
